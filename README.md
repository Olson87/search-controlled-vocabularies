# search-controlled-vocabularies
DataONEâ€™s Arctic Data Center project on controlled vocabularies concerning ecosystem concepts.
Project Goals include: 
1)Compiling relevent "external" vocabularies and intergrating them into the current ECSO ontology 
2)Identifying poorly constructed vocabularies to incorporate 
3)Constructing new relevant vocabularies to support the existing database holdings 
4)Provide user-testing and feedback on DataONE's annotations and search tools during archiving Synthesis data products
